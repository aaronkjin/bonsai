## Technologies Used

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Combine framework (for handling asynchronous events and data streams)

## Features

- Expense Tracking: Log and monitor personal expenses with ease
- Visual Trends: Utilize line graphs from SwiftUICharts to observe monthly spending trends

## Background

Inspired by the meticulous care and attention to detail in caring for bonsai trees, I saw a similar approach for managing personal finances. Bonsai, the app, translates this philosophy into a practical tool for everyday financial tracking, empowering users to shape their financial future with each logged expense.

## Notes

Bonsai is my first project using Swift and SwiftUI, where I chose for this tech stack to align with the clean, intuitive design philosophy of Apple. The development process was both a learning opportunity as well as a fun experience, providing a solid foundation for future projects in iOS app development.
