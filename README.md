### Background and Inspiration

I've always been captivated by the elegance of bonsai trees. The patience and precision required to shape them into works of art fascinated me. It got me thinking - could this same philosophy apply to personal finances?

So, I decided to create Bonsai, an expense tracking iOS app that embodies the essence of bonsai in finance. I'm not a financial guru; I'm just someone who values every dollar earned. Bonsai is my way of bringing mindfulness to money. It's about simplicity, clarity, and the power of small, deliberate actions. With Bonsai, you can effortlessly track expenses, set achievable goals, and gain control over your financial journey. Just as each twist and turn of a branch adds character to a bonsai, each expense logged in Bonsai shapes your financial future.

Woah, that sounded almost... poetic.

### Details and Features

- Technologies used: Swift and SwiftUI.
- Line graph from SwiftUICharts detailing trends in spending for the month.
- Recent Transactions section to show the last five spendings.
- Transactions page that shows spending by month in reverse chronological order.
- Backend that fetches a list of transactions from a remote JSON API using Combine framework.
- Beautiful SwiftUI icons that matches the type of spending (e.g. "Restaurants" show a "Fork & Knife" icon).
- Light/Dark mode.

### Notes

This was my first app built using Swift and SwiftUI. I think building apps with this specific language + framework provides me with a rigid structure to build simple, clean, and very "Apple-y" apps. I'm excited to dive further with Swift/SwiftUI development as the whole development process with Bonsai was both fun and enriching!
